Cryptography Algorithms
About
This repository contains various implementations of classical and modern cryptographic algorithms, including:

Caesar Cipher: A substitution cipher that shifts letters in the alphabet.
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: A method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.
Hill Cipher: A polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.
Monoalphabetic Cipher: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter with a fixed relationship.
Polyalphabetic Cipher: A method of encrypting alphabetic text by using multiple substitution alphabets.
RSA Cipher: An asymmetric encryption algorithm widely used for secure data transmission.
Vigen√®re Cipher: A method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
